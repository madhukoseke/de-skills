## Summary
The best implementation is a dbt incremental model with deterministic merge semantics and explicit test coverage integrated with airflow orchestration.

## Decision
Use dbt `incremental` materialization, define unique keys for deduplication, and add schema.yml tests for not_null, unique, and relationship checks.

## Rationale
Incremental processing reduces warehouse cost while preserving correctness. dbt handles transformation logic, while airflow should orchestrate execution only.

## Trade-offs
| Option | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| dbt incremental + tests | Efficient and testable | Requires model discipline | Large recurring transforms |
| Full-refresh table | Simple logic | Expensive at scale | Small/rarely updated tables |

## Next Steps
1. Implement model SQL with incremental filter and merge key.
2. Add schema.yml test definitions and run dbt test in CI.
3. Keep airflow limited to scheduling and dependency orchestration.
