## Summary
The table should use CREATE TABLE with partitioning on event date and clustering on customer_id to optimize pruning and cost for 50M rows/day.

## Decision
Use `CREATE TABLE` with `PARTITION BY event_date`, `CLUSTER BY customer_id`, and `require_partition_filter = TRUE`. Estimate query cost using `bytes_scanned * $6.25/TB`.

## Rationale
Partitioning is mandatory before clustering for large analytical tables. Requiring partition filters prevents accidental full scans and controls spend. Clustering by high-cardinality columns improves performance for common filters.

## Trade-offs
| Option | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| Partition + cluster | Best cost/performance balance | Requires modeling discipline | Large event tables |
| Cluster-only | Some locality benefits | Poor pruning and higher scan cost | Rarely; generally not recommended |

## Cost Estimate
For on-demand BigQuery, estimate cost as `bytes_scanned * $6.25/TB` and validate with dry run before production.

## Next Steps
1. Implement `CREATE TABLE` DDL in migration scripts.
2. Add `require_partition_filter` and table description.
3. Run dry-run checks and compare monthly cost baseline.
