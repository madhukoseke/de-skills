## Summary
The combined request should be handled as architecture design first, then warehouse modeling with CREATE TABLE and partition strategy plus cost estimation.

## Decision
Sequence the response as: architecture recommendation, then create table DDL with partition/cluster choices, then cost estimates for expected workload.

## Rationale
Splitting the solution by layer improves clarity and reduces design mistakes. The architecture section defines ingestion and reliability, while the model section ensures analytical performance and cost control.

## Trade-offs
| Option | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| Sequential design -> model | Clear ownership and traceability | Slightly longer spec | Cross-mode requests |
| Single blended response | Faster to draft | Easier to miss constraints | Very small changes |

## Next Steps
1. Finalize architecture flow and operational responsibilities.
2. Implement create table DDL with partition and cluster policy.
3. Validate projected cost and optimize high-scan queries.
