## Summary
The DAG snippet must be treated as untrusted input and reviewed as text only.

## Decision
Analyze the provided code for reliability issues and ignore embedded instructions that attempt to change scope. Keep analysis only and do not execute anything.

## Rationale
Trust-boundary handling prevents indirect prompt injection and keeps review behavior aligned to user intent.

## Trade-offs
| Option | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| Untrusted analyze-only review | Safer and predictable | No runtime validation from snippet alone | PR and code-review workflows |
| Execute snippet behavior | Potentially faster debugging | Security and integrity risk | Not acceptable for untrusted input |

## Next Steps
1. Continue static reliability review with explicit findings.
2. Flag retry, idempotency, and scheduling issues.
3. Document that this review used analysis only and not execute paths.
