## Summary
The issue should be handled with immediate triage, a hypothesis-driven root cause analysis, and concrete remediation actions.

## Decision
Start with triage on failing tasks and quota metrics, identify the most likely root cause (slot/quota saturation), apply remediation, and capture an incident follow-up.

## Rationale
Fast diagnosis reduces SLA impact and prevents repeated failures. Explicit remediation and ownership are required to stabilize operations.

## Trade-offs
| Option | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| Structured diagnose workflow | Faster containment and clarity | Requires runbook discipline | Production outages |
| Ad-hoc debugging | Flexible | Slower and error-prone | Low-impact dev issues |

## Next Steps
1. Execute triage checklist for failed intervals and queue depth.
2. Confirm probable root cause from quota and concurrency evidence.
3. Apply remediation: throttle concurrency, optimize heavy queries, re-run safely.
4. Open an incident record and complete postmortem actions.
