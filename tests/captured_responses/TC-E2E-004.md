## Summary
A clustered-only design for a 2TB table is an anti-pattern; the model should be partitioned first and then clustered.

## Decision
Reject cluster-only design as not recommended. Use partition by business date and cluster by high-selectivity columns.

## Rationale
Partitioning is the primary control for scan reduction and predictable cost, while cluster improves locality within each partition. Cluster without partition causes expensive broad scans.

## Trade-offs
| Option | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| Partition + cluster | Better pruning and runtime performance | Needs careful column choice | Large analytical tables |
| Cluster only | Minor ordering benefit | Weak pruning and high cost | Rarely justified |

## Next Steps
1. Define partition strategy from query date filters.
2. Choose 1-4 cluster columns from frequent filters and joins.
3. Validate cost and latency with dry-run and benchmark queries.
