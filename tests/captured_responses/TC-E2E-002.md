## Summary
The request is underspecified, so the correct behavior is to pause final design and collect missing context first.

## Decision
Before proposing architecture, ask for source details, destination target, expected volume, freshness requirement, and SLA constraints.

## Rationale
A pipeline decision without concrete source characteristics, destination contracts, and operational expectations is likely to introduce rework and reliability risk.

## Trade-offs
| Option | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| Clarify inputs first | Better design quality and fewer reversals | Adds one discovery step | Incomplete problem statements |
| Guess architecture | Fast initial response | High risk of wrong solution | Never for production design |

## Next Steps
1. Confirm source type and schema shape.
2. Confirm destination dataset/table and consumer expectations.
3. Quantify daily volume and peak behavior.
4. Define freshness target and exact SLA.
5. Proceed with architecture recommendation after inputs are complete.
