## Summary
A cost audit should identify top spend drivers, rank fixes by impact, and prioritize partition-aware query optimization.

## Decision
Analyze billing and query history, produce a top offender list, and rank remediation actions by expected savings and implementation effort.

## Rationale
Ranking changes by impact ensures the team addresses the largest cost contributors first. Use bytes-scanned signals and partition pruning checks to cut unnecessary scans.

## Trade-offs
| Option | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| Ranked cost optimization plan | Measurable savings roadmap | Requires usage data quality | Ongoing FinOps governance |
| One-off query tuning | Quick spot fixes | Misses systemic waste | Urgent single-query incidents |

## Cost Estimate
Use BigQuery on-demand formula `bytes_scanned * $6.25/TB` to quantify expected monthly savings per action.

## Next Steps
1. Build top query and pipeline cost baseline for last 30 days.
2. Rank optimization items and assign owners.
3. Enforce partition pruning and required partition filters in review gates.
